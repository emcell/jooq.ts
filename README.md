# tsooq

This project aims to provide a replacement for [jOOQ](https://www.jooq.org/) from the java world.

I've always loved to use jOOQ in my java or kotlin projects. This has always
been the missing part of the typescript eco system for me.

This library is experimental and in early stages. Don't use this in prodcution.

# How do develop

Start the typescript compiler in watch mode

```bash
yarn watch
```

Run tests

```bash
docker-compose up -d
yarn test
```
